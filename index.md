## Research project
My thesis is studying diagnosis of prostate cancer, through multiparametric MRI using Non-negative Tensor Factorisation.
Diagnosis of prostate cancer through MRI is the second line of defence, after an overspecific test (PSA blood test & TRUS biopsy). Early detection of prostate cancer is becoming increasingly important, with two-fifths of prostate cancers diagnosed at a late stage, according to the chartity Orchid (UK). With an abundance of available clinical data, particularly multiparametric MRI, it may be challenging to know where to start. My research project focuses on both the abundance of clinical data available from MRI scans and areas in demand from clinicians. 

### Research Hypothesis
Applying machine learning methodologies that are able to deal with multiparametric MRI, in an unsupervised or a semi-supervised manner, can improve the diagnosis and segmentation of prostate cancer.

## Research interests
I am interested in machine learning methodologies and interpretability, allowing for meaningful and impactful results. Previous work has looked at using methods such as Support Vector Machines for classification of prostate lesions from a challenge data set. Work is being conducted in collaboration with the [Clatterbridge Cancer Centre](https://www.clatterbridgecc.nhs.uk/), to lead towards real-world clinical impact.

## Biography
I attained my Mathematics BSc (Hons) in 2017 and my Data Science MSc in 2018, at [Liverpool John Moores University, (LJMU)](https://www.ljmu.ac.uk). During the MSc I completed a Curriculum Enhancement Internship for creating better clustering analysis tools in R. In 2018 I attained acceptance onto my PhD within the Machine Learning Group at LJMU; my supervisor is [Dr Sandra Ortega Martorell](https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/about-us/staff-profiles/faculty-of-engineering-and-technology/department-of-applied-mathematics/sandra-ortega-martorell)

## Skills
### Programming and coding
I am proficient in using the R programming language, in which I have completed various research projects with machine leraning techniques. I have acquired skills in Python and MATLAB.

## Previous degrees
2018 - Data Science MSc, Liverpool John Moores University. Distinction.
2017 - Mathematics BSc (Hons), Liverpool John Moores University. 1st Class.

## Outreach & teaching activities
I have conducted a set of voluntry workshops within the Department of Applied Mathematics at LJMU, to deliver content on R/RStudio to multidisciplinary students - to those with, and without, prior programming knowledge. Students have fed back positively on the workshops. 

## Funding 
I am funded by the Liverpool John Moores University PhD Scholarship fund.
